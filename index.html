          LYRICS<br><br>
          Now and then I think of when we were together<br>
          Like when you said you felt so happy you could die<br>
          Told myself that you were right for me<br>
          But felt so lonely in your company<br>
          But that was love and it's an ache I still remember<br><br>
          You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness<br>
          Like resignation to the end<br>
          Always the end<br>
          So when we found that we could not make sense<br>
          Well you said that we would still be friends<br>
          But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over<br><br>
          But you didn't have to cut me off<br>
          Make out like it never happened<br>
          And that we were nothing<br>
          And I don't even need your love<br>
          But you treat me like a stranger<br>
          And that feels so rough<br>
          You didn't have to stoop so low<br>
          Have your friends collect your records<br>
          And then change your number<br>
          I guess that I don't need that though<br>
          Now you're just somebody that I used to know<br><br>
          Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over<br>
          But had me believing it was always something that I'd done<br>
          And I don't wanna live that way<br>
          Reading into every word you say<br>
          You said that you could let it go<br>
          And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know...<br><br>
          But you didn't have to cut me off<br>
          Make out like it never happened<br>
          And that we were nothing<br>
          And I don't even need your love<br>
          But you treat me like a stranger<br>
          And that feels so rough<br>
          You didn't have to stoop so low<br>
          Have your friends collect your records<br>
          And then change your number<br>
          I guess that I don't need that though<br>
          Now you're just somebody that I used to know<br><br>
          I used to know<br>
          That I used to know<br><br>
          Somebody...<br>
